# ScanningProcess

`ScanningProcess` is used to simulate scanning procedure, in which codes are runned with a period, in a JavaScript environment. 

When a `ScanningProcess` starts, it runs the first `action` , which is stored in its `ScanningProcess.actions` , by calling `action.func()` again and again, with a waiting period of `action.duration` , until the `action` is determined done when `action.func()` returns `true` . 

After an `action` is done, `ScanningProcess` will start the next `action` , until the `ScanningProcess.actions` are all done.

## Usage

Return `true` when you think an `action` is done, and `false` if you think an `action` is not done yet. 

`duration` is in milliseconds.

```js
let sp = new ScanningProcess([{
func: function() {
    someButton.click();
    return true;
},
duration: 100
}, {
func: function() {
    if (resultIsRendered()) {
        getRenderedResult();
        return true;
    }
    return false;
},
duration: 500
}]])

sp.run();
```

You can set a default options, like `duration` , in `defaults` so you don't have to declare `duration` s in every `action` s. In the example below, the `someButton` action and `anotherButton` action will have a duration of 100ms, whilst the `getRenderedResult` action will have a duration of 500ms.

```js
let sp = new ScanningProcess([{
    func: function() {
        someButton.click();
        return true;
    }
}, {
    func: function() {
        if (resultIsRendered()) {
            getRenderedResult();
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    },
    duration: 500
}, {
    func: function() {
        anotherButton.click();
        return true;
    }
}], {
    duration: 100
});
```
